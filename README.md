# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Pewlett Harcard is a large company that has several thousand employees and a generation of employees are beginning to retire at a rapid rate causing the 'Silver Tsunami.' To prepare for the upcoming 'Silver Tsuami' the HR manager wants to do the following to future proof the company:
	* Migrate their current employee data stored in 6 CSV files into a more scalable database
	* Estbalish a company retirement criteria to predict the next upcoming 'Silver Tsuamis'
	* How many positons will need to be filled

## Results
* Total retiring titles 72458
* Total retiring leadership titles (Senior Staff, Senior Engineers, Technical Leaders, Managers) 54447
* Total mentorship eligible employees 1549
* The most impacted departments: Development, Production, Sales, Customer Service

## Summary
The current 'Silver Tsuami' will be a lost of 72458 employees at once. The four most impacted departments are Development, Production, Sales, and Customer Service with more than a 10,000 employee deficit. A major lost of leadership and senior staff across the company. This Silver Tsumani is worse than expected once the numbers have been establish. The mentorship program is promising, the number of eligible employees verses the estimated amount of new hires is barely 50%. Currently for every 47 new hires there will only be 1 mentor to train them, which is unrealistic. Also there is not a duration of the mentorship program established and realistically it would take longer than a month for each new hire to be full equipped with the knowledge required to be successful.

## Recommendations
To compensate for the sigificant workforce lost, the requirement of mentors to be 8 years from retirement should be lowered to at least 5 years and possibly make the employees who have been prompted to leadership roles eligible as well. This cast a wider net for mentors and the ratio of mentor vs new hires more realistic.
